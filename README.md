# capstone-data-analysis
This project is the capstone project of the  Google Data Analytics professional certificate program.
In this project, we analyze Bike-share company's data to find ways to optimize membership and increase revenue.
The analysis was done using R programming language, and further analysis and visualization was done using spreadsheet.
Steps involved include: Data collection, Data Wranggling, Data cleaning, Descriptive Analysis and Visualization.
For references, I have included the script file and few screenshots of sample output and visualization.
